# VSCode UI Scripting Example Project

This is a basic implementation project of our VSCode Plugin "VSCode UI Scripting".

## Setup

Install required node modules

        `npm install`

## Review VSCode Plugin Setup

1. Look at how the vus-config.json file is setup in the root of the project.
2. Look at how the vus-meta.json file is setup in the root of the project.
3. Look at the how the vus-meta.json file is setup in components directory.
4. Look at the custom method that is hooked up to our vus-config.json, under `methods/addComponents.js`
5. Right click on various folders and files to see how the commands interact with the various `vus-meta.json` files, based on inheritted options.

Feel free to play with the configs and see what happens.
